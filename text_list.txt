Although Eniac Ventures began investing in 2010, the roots trace back to four like-minded engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania where the founding GPs met over two decades ago. After college, our partners set out on separate but parallel paths as startup operators and founders and maintained a strong bond and network of support.
Today, our combined 80 years of experience founding and operating over 10 venture-backed startups and our belief in a strong community are at the heart and soul of our investment approach.Thanks for your patience.
